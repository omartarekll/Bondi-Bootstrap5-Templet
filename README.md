# Bondi Bootstrap 5 Project

This is my first project using **Bootstrap 5** and its **grid system**.  
I built it with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **Bootstrap 5**, and **Font Awesome**.

I wanted to practice building a responsive layout and get used to how Bootstrap’s classes work.

## What I learned

- How to use the grid system to organize sections.
- How to use Bootstrap utilities and components.
- How to add icons with Font Awesome.
- How can I use git and SSH kay

## Tools

- VS Code
- Cmder
- Git & GitHub

It’s a small step, but it helped me understand Bootstrap much better.
